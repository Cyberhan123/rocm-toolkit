# rocm-toolkit

This action installs the [AMD ROCmâ„¢](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest) on the system. It adds the rocm install location as `ROCM_PATH` to `GITHUB_ENV` so you can access the CUDA install location in subsequent steps. `CUDA_PATH/bin` is added to `GITHUB_PATH` so you can use commands such as `nvcc` directly in subsequent steps. Right now only `windows-latest` is supported. 
## Inputs

Default: `'5.5.0'`.

```yaml
